mdb-sqlite.NET
==============

mdb-sqlite.NET is originally based on [mdb-sqlite] project (https://code.google.com/p/mdb-sqlite/) which created by Landon Fuller(landon.j.fuller@gmail.com).

I have made some modify and translate it into .NET C# version.

To use this tool you will need to install [System.Data.SQLite] package (http://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki) via NuGet, then you are ready to GO!


Description
==============

Provides automated conversion of MS Access databases(*.mdb) to SQLite.
